STEP 1: Create Adjacency Matrix for the given graph.
STEP 2: Replace all the diagonal elements with the degree of nodes
STEP 3: Replace all non-diagonal 1â€™s with -1.
STEP 4: Calculate co-factor for any element.
STEP 5: The cofactor that you get is the total number of spanning tree for that graph.
